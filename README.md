# Learn Core Java

## Overview

This course is an internal course given in November 2013 for BIST developers. Course is divided into 10 half-day program. BEWARE! Each day you will be **pushed to your limits** to understand the dynamics of the language.

After each session, you'll be given a homework and these homeworks will be scored (On a scale of **1 to 10**).

End of the course, you'll also be given a test to score your skills. 40% of your homeworks and 60% of your test score will give you your final score.  Anyone below **7 overall will not be certified**!
