	/**
	 * OBJECTIVE:
	 * 
	 * A simple DB table (called Employee) and a DB Shell will be simulated in the homework.
	 * 
	 * DB table should contain the below fields:
	 * - ID (long): ID fields must be unique.
	 * - FirstName (String)
	 * - LastName (String)
	 * - Age (int)
	 * - BirthDate (Date): Dates should be stored in YYYYMMDD format. Example date: 19800504
	 * - Salary (BigDecimal)
	 * 
	 * User should interact with the DB using a CLI-based shell. Shell should enlist the available operations
	 * and should guide the user during the process.
	 * - findAllEmployees();
	 * - findEmployeeById(long employeeId);
	 * - createEmployee(Employee employee);
	 * - deleteEmployeeById(long employeeId);
	 * - updateSalary(long employeeId, BigDecimal newSalary); 
	 * 
	 * Result of the operations should be printed to the screen. Employee data should be preserved in a CSV file,
	 * such as employee.csv.
	 * 
	 * Good luck!
