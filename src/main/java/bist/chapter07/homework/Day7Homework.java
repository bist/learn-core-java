    * OBJECTIVE:
    *
    * Create a nxm mine field. Randomly distribute some mines
    * on this field (you can use bitmap arrays kinda logic to represent fields)
    * Create 3-4 worker threads to find mine locations on this field
    * and make sure that they are destroying the mines without interfering
    * each other.
    *
    * Before starting the workers, also print the field to the terminal.
    *
    * CAUTION:
    *
    * - Make sure that they don't destroy or work on the same mine.
    * - You may run into race conditions, find a way to skip mines if they
    * are already destroyed.
