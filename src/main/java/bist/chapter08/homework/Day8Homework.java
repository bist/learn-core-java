	/**
	 * OBJECTIVE:
	 * 
	 * A simple DB table (called Employee) and a DB Shell will be implemented in the homework, as in Homework 6. 
	 * But, this time DB table, Employee, will be created in HSQLDB and the DB shell will be able to connect  
	 * this DB remotely. 
	 * 
	 * Multiple shells can be opened to the database.
	 * 
	 * DB table should contain the exact same fields and the DB shell should support the exact same operations, 
	 * mentioned in Homework 6.
	 * 
	 * To support remote communication between DB shells and the database, you might the need to implement a
	 * custom protocol to differentiate different operations and to demarcate the beginning and the end of 
	 * the exchanged messages.
	 *  
	 * Good luck!
